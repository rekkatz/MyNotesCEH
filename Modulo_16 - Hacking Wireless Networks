Modulo 16 - Hacking Wireless Networks
------------------------------------------------

Extension to a wired network: A wired network is extended by the introduction of access points between the wired network and wireless devices
Multiple access points: Multiple access points connect computers wirelessly
LAN-to-LAN wireless network: All hardware APs have the ability to interconnect with other hardware access points
3G/4G hotspot: A mobile device shares its cellular data wirelessly with Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as MP3 players, notebooks, tablets, cameras, PDAs, and netbooks

1 - Perform Wireless Traffic Analysis

	1.1 - Wi-Fi Packet Analysis using Wireshark

2 - Perform Wireless Attacks

	# Fragmentation attack: When successful, such attacks can obtain 1,500 bytes of PRGA (pseudo random generation algorithm)

	# MAC spoofing attack: The attacker changes their MAC address to that of an authenticated user in order to bypass the access point’s MAC-filtering configuration
	
	# Disassociation attack: The attacker makes the victim unavailable to other wireless devices by destroying the connectivity between the access point and client
	
	# Deauthentication attack: The attacker floods station(s) with forged deauthentication packets to disconnect users from an access point
	
	# Man-in-the-middle attack: An active Internet attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept, read, or alter information between two computers
	
	# Wireless ARP poisoning attack: An attack technique that exploits the lack of a verification mechanism in the ARP protocol by corrupting the ARP cache maintained by the OS in order to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the target host
	
	# Rogue access points: Wireless access points that an attacker installs on a network without authorization and that are not under the management of the network administrator
	
	# Evil twin: A fraudulent wireless access point that pretends to be a legitimate access point by imitating another network name
	
	# Wi-Jacking attack: A method used by attackers to gain access to an enormous number of wireless networks

	2.1 - Crack a WEP network using Aircrack-ng

	2.2 - Crack a WPA2 network using Aircrack-ng
		># aircrack-ng -a2 -b [Target BSSID] -w /home/attacker/Desktop/Wordlist/password.txt '/home/attacker/Desktop/Sample Captures/WPA2crack-01.cap'
